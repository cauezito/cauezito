# CauÃª Santos

Senior mobile developer specialized in Android and working with Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) and Compose Multiplatform (CMP).

I focus on building robust and maintainable mobile solutions that run on both Android and iOS platforms. I always prioritize clean architecture, scalability, high code quality, testing, observability, and accessibility.

With over 5 years of experience in Android development, I've worked across various stages of the mobile development lifecycle.
